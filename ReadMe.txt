A Matlab code for calculating the fractal dimension based on structure data

Code requires
- a dump data from lammps including MolID, AtomID, AtomType, Atom Weight (or manually input into the fractal.m), and Atom Coordinate
- a bond information data, same as bond definition in lammps [bondID bondype bondAtom1 bondAtom2]

Run fractal.m
